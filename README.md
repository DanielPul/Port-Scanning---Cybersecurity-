To use the script before. 

Save the code to a file with a .py extension (e.g., tcp_port_scanner.py).
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
Follow the prompts to enter the target host IP address or hostname, as well as the range of ports to scan.

This script uses the socket module to create TCP sockets and attempt
connections to the specified ports on the target host. If a connection is successful, 
the script reports that the port is open; otherwise, it reports that the port is closed.
Adjust the timeout value (sock.settimeout()) as needed depending on your network environment and requirements. 
Additionally, please ensure that you have appropriate permissions to perform port
scanning activities on the target network.

Thak you.
